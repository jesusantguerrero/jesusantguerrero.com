Its been more than a month since the first time I decided to investigate and learn about blockchain, crypto, smart contracts and dapps A.K.A Web 3.0 it was in september 24, of 2021 I set this as a goal. I first came to the term in twitter but it was more hype than truly helpful information with some valuable exceptions that share a roadmap and I found the first treasure [cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) after completing some chapters and reading the documentation of [ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/) I wrote a post about my learnings called [web 3.0 for mortals](https://dev.to/jesusantguerrero/web-3-0-for-mortals-3h04) and dropped my first contracts with [Bending Battle](https://github.com/jesusantguerrero/bending-battle) heres my roadmap to get at this point in a month:

- Learning the concept of blockchain
- Learn basics of solidity
- Learn about standards, libraries, security
- Working on my dev environment with hardhat
- Built a card game inspired in cryptozombies and Avatar the legend of Aang
- Deploying to testnets
- Build an NFT
- Build a marketplace
- Learn about tokenURI's and IPFS.
- Build an NFT the right way. 
- Deploy to contracts to testnets
