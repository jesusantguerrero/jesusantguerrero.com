Its been more than a month since the first time I decided to investigate and learn about blockchain, crypto, smart contracts and dapps A.K.A Web 3.0 it was in september 24, of 2021 I set this as a goal. I first came to the term in twitter but it was more hype than truly helpful information with some valuable exceptions that share a roadmap and I found the first treasure [cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) after completing some chapters and reading the documentation of [ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/) I wrote a post about my learnings called [web 3.0 for mortals](https://dev.to/jesusantguerrero/web-3-0-for-mortals-3h04) and dropped my first contracts with [Bending Battle](https://github.com/jesusantguerrero/bending-battle) heres my roadmap to get at this point in a month:

### Go back in history
1994: what is internet anyway?

internet/email was kind of hype.

#### Web 3 key concerns: 

1 - Data (Data ownership) -> Data monarchy to Data Democrasy -> Decentralization
2 - Governance 
3 - Money (Transactions)

#### Implementation
1 - Data privacy is garanteed throug cryptography.  

2 - Manage society throug the blockchain protocol -> all the rules are defined in the blockchain and smart-contracts (DAO's)

3 - Smart Contracts
