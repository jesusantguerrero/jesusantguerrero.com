Every person that wants to improve their time management skills dreams about finding the right productivity tool for their case.

This is a very hard and tricky task because there are a lot of tools and techniques that claim to be the perfect ones to boost your productivity, but I think that **being productive is more about the feeling** than tooling or a single application, so probably, your perfect system would require mixing some techniques, changing them a little bit, and combine a couple of applications.

Some of the aspects that I think a productivity system should have:

- [[The perfect productivity system should have short steps|Short steps]].
- [[The perfect productivity system should have no more than 3 views|It shouldn't have more than 3 views]].
- [[The perfect productivity system should adapt to your life style|It should adapt to your life style]].


### Building the big picture
Something like [shape up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01) looks like a good idea to provide the big picture of the system.

Six week cycles. with specific goals attached to a project that will be the only focus for the next six weeks.

- Cycles
  - Objectives of the cycle
    - Tasks to accomplish the objective
### Building a second brain
The second brain seems like a good way to collect data, ideas and insights about topics that are attached to a project.

The [PARA method](https://maggieappleton.com/basb) is one of the ways to build a second brain, the central piece would be 
 **projects** that are categorized by **Areas** and we collect **Resources** to helps us learn/understand the topic to build a project.
### Building the short picture in an action driven app
As a human every day is a challenge and is the building block of our goals, sometimes we lose focus and forget to work on the actions that get us closer to those year goals we have and spent time on things that don't matter at all. If we don't keep track of the actions we should make daily in order to get closer to our goals we wont accomplish them.

I call this the action view.

1 - Make a weekly plan
2-  Do the most important task first
3 - Take breaks after some time
