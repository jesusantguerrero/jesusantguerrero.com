Every person that wants to improve their time management skills dreams about finding the right productivity tool for their case.

This is a very hard and tricky task because there are a lot of tools and techniques that claim to be the perfect ones to boost your productivity, but I think that [[being productive is more about the feeling]] than tooling or a single application, so probably your perfect system would require mixing some techniques, changing them a little bit, and combine a couple of applications.

In this post, I want to explore some of the aspects to help you find the best productivity system for you.

### How many steps it takes to apply?
Planning, acting, measure, and review are the most common steps you will find in many techniques and applications.

For example, I love the Eisenhower Matrix technique because is so simple 


### **View**
In every step of a workflow, you will have views that let you see the information of what you want versus what you need to do to take you there.


1. Big picture view

The planning, measure, and review steps require to present information about the big picture of your activities should be made after a period of time there are daily, weekly, monthly, 6-week based systems.



2. Action view

I discovered I am better with  6 weeks to cover measurable goals/objectives and daily plans to describe the tasks that will take me there.

### **Actions**

More than a guide is fairer to say that this is my reflection on my own search for the best productivity system for myself. And I would like to read your opinion what you take into account so let me know in the comments.
