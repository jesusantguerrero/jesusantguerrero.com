Every person that wants to improve their time management skills dreams about finding the right productivity tool for their case.

This is a very hard and tricky task because there are a lot of tools and techniques that claim to be the perfect ones to boost your productivity, but I think that **being productive is more about the feeling** than tooling or a single application, so probably your perfect system would require mixing some techniques, changing them a little bit, and combine a couple of applications.

In this post, I want to explore some of the aspects to help you find the best productivity system:

- [[The perfect productivity system should have short steps|It should have short steps]].
- [[The perfect productivity system should have no more than 3 views|It shouldn't have more than 3 steps]].
- [[The perfect productivity system should adapt to your life style|It should adapt to your life style]].
