I decided to investigate and learn about blockchain, crypto, smart contracts and dapps A.K.A Web 3.0 from september 24, of 2021. I got curious about the term from the hype on twitter but it was more hype than truly helpful information with some valuable exceptions that shared a roadmap on how to get started with Web3.

I am kind of documenting my journey and sharing my learning process hoping that can be useful for someone else but also expressing my own opinion.

## 1 - Learn the concepts.
It is kind of hard to assimilate and embrace an idea that challenge the status quo in so many ways. We tend to be cautious, exceptive and critic about it and even more when we just listen all roses and anything negative from the people trying to sell it to us.

By reading about the idea, the goals the key concepts behind how it works, the flaws and the things web3 need to improve to materialize the goal we emphasize more with it.

[Ethereum Docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/) are a good place to start.
[Web2 vs Web3](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/)
I wrote about this in my article [an honest look at web3](https://dev.to/jesusantguerrero/web-3-0-for-mortals-3h04)

## 2 - Consume
Start to consume dapps and use Web3, Brave browser to gain tokens for view to the adds, installed my metamask wallet, look for dapps on the web, and start to follow people on twitter that provide useful content and resources.


## 3 - Get your hands dirty.
The primary blockchain to build smart-contracts and dapps is Ethereum in addition its platform Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is compatible with other platform Polygon(Matic) for example, so by learning solidity, one of the language of the platform you can make smart-contracts for multiple blockchains.

[cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) is an excelent resource that cover all the things you need to know to build your first contracts and dapps. since the basics of the language, libraries,ERC721 how to use other contracts with yours, how to handle security, how to connect with oracles to how to connect your fontend with a smart contract. All this in an interactive gamified tutorial.

## 4 - Build, build and build.
- Working on my dev environment with hardhat
- Built a card game inspired in cryptozombies and Avatar the legend of Aang
## 5 - Deploying to the world.
- Deploying to testnets

- Build an NFT the right way. 
- Deploy to contracts to testnets
 and I found the first treasure [cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) after completing some chapters and reading the documentation of [ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/) I wrote a post about my learnings called [web 3.0 for mortals](https://dev.to/jesusantguerrero/web-3-0-for-mortals-3h04) and dropped my first contracts with [Bending Battle](https://github.com/jesusantguerrero/bending-battle) heres my roadmap to get at this point in a month:

## 6 - Learning about cryptocurrencies
Cryptocurrencies are the fuel of Web3 they move the economy, they move the smart contracts and transactions that happens in the platforms. if you take a look at them you will see that most of these tokens have a platform behind Ether has Ethereum ecosystem, Links has Chainlink which is a set of oracles that you can use in your dapps, Solana is also an ecosystem that have its own a blockchain that allows you to build smart-contracts and so on.

[Binance](https://binance.com/) and 
[CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies) and youtube channels has helped me with that and watch out with the scammers.
 ## 7 - Iterate and get stronger.
With every step you get better and better in the next iteration you can build a more robust environment setup with an advanced hardhat setup for example.

Complement your dapps with services like Moralis, Infura, Piniata for IPFS storage, etc.

## 8 - Going out of the comfort zone. 
Participating in hackathons at least once in life is a good way to inspire you and put you in the zone. In this state you can apply all the things you are learning, brainstorm ideas, see a lot of use cases for new technologies, interact with other developers and find communities with the same interest as you.

I participated in the chainlink hackathon I dont know if I am going to win anything yet, but the things I learned and applied are very valuable.
