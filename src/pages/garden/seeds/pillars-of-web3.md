I can help to be critic about the things I filter to learn, to see if they are is worthy or at least fun to try. Maybe you're aware about my journey with web3 since I wrote about it a couple of times if not you can read my article [web3 for mortals]() and my [[thoughts on web3]] and [[my-roadmap-on-web3]] it might provide some insights and resources. But in this one I am going to take a more wide and maybe not so detailed aspect of web 3, the pillars.

### I - The concept.
This is were the beauty of web 3 is, for me web3 is not about blockchains and NFT's, etc they are the tools, mids to the materialize the goal but the concept is decentralization, user ownership/privacy while providing built in support for payments. 

That's why when detractors point out that Ethereum is slow, expensive, NFT's are just images, etc, I think we are missing the target, It is like evaluating calculators we code to learn a new language before do the useful.



Once you know the direction and goal. you're ready to learn the tools.

### II - The tools.


### III - Development.
### IV - Cryptocurrencies.
