This is my first year of doing a year in review. This have been by far my most productive years so far in all aspects of life so I thing it deserve to have an spot here in my personal space.

## Highlights:
- Decided to start the challenge of 12x12 (12 projects in a year) even though I have fallen short of the goal I build interesting things and I am happy with the result [Sunday](https://github.com/jesusantguerrero/sunday), [treasurer](https://github.com/jesusantguerrero/insane-treasurer), [journal](https://github.com/insane-code/journal).

- I participated in my first hackathon ever [Vercel+Hashnode Hackathon](https://freesgen.hashnode.dev/introduction-to-zen) and launched my side project with most users so far with [zen](https://github.com/jesusantguerrero/zen).

- Started bloging consistently first in [hashnode]() then in [dev.to]
