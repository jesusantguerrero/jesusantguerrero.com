This is my first year of doing a year in review. This have been by far my most productive years so far in all aspects of life so I thing it deserve to have an spot here in my personal space.

## Development:
- I participated in my first hackathon ever [Vercel+Hashnode Hackathon](https://freesgen.hashnode.dev/introduction-to-zen) and launched my side project with most users so far with [zen](https://github.com/jesusantguerrero/zen).

- Learned solidity, decentralized apps and blockchain (A.K.A Web 3) and participated in a hackathon of that topic winning one of the prizes with [rooster fight](https://devpost.com/software/roosterfight).

## Writing
Started blogging consistently first in [hashnode](https://freesgen.hashnode.dev/) then in [dev.to](https://dev.to/jesusantguerrero) that's 9 more than the previous year.

I wrote 9 articles in this year tops were

- [My roadmap in web 3](https://dev.to/jesusantguerrero/my-roadmap-in-web-3-1hgo)
- [Dealing with timezones in web development](https://dev.to/jesusantguerrero/dealing-with-timezones-in-web-development-2dgg)

## Reading
It was a slow year for me I read more Articles than books my top 3 would be.

- [Shape up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) by Ryan Singer

- [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) by Maggie Appleton.

- [https://blog.eduardovedes.com/note-taking-for-software-engineers](https://blog.eduardovedes.com/note-taking-for-software-engineers) by Eduardo Vedes.
where he mentions an interesting concept of second brain.
## Special mentions
- Decided to start the challenge of 12x12 (12 projects in a year) even though I have fallen short of the goal I build interesting things and I am happy with the result [Sunday](https://github.com/jesusantguerrero/sunday), [treasurer](https://github.com/jesusantguerrero/insane-treasurer), [journal](https://github.com/insane-code/journal).
