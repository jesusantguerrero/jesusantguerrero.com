This month of July 2022 mark my first 5 years of professional experience as a software developer, counting from the first freelance job; during that period, it has been a lot of learning, some of my beliefs have been reinforced, or challenged and others needed to be re-learned to fit in the real world.

## **Background.**

Why software engineering?

I can say that my life splits in two the day I discover how software is made being able to create something from text and dragging components from an editor amazed me from the first time  and I would sit in the school's lab doing the common programs for the class (calculators) and doing my little projects like a clone of the login and home of Facebook in Delphy back in the day.

From that year until 2017 I was just playing around with languages like C, C++, Java, and C# doing CLI programs for my classes or experiments just as a hobby until I learned decent English in 2016 and met the web, made my first web application an sold it to a local ISP company.

My drivers were **curiosity** and the **creative nature** of development but also the fact that I could create things to make other people's jobs easier, we are **the support career by excellence**.

## **Big take-away**s

### **Do Something you like**

There’s a dilemma I hear constantly about if you need to have passion for your job or give the extra mile I find more regarding doing something you like for work if you have the opportunity to do so. as learning and progress will be something that you see like challenges.

-   **Discipline:** It is easier to keep discipline by doing things you like rather than doing it just for the bag.
-   **Better to have rather than 2 days a month:** If you are just happy on the paydays the other days must be like a prison.

### Holistic Approach

Try to see the whole picture, even when you don't have to take part in the whole process to learn how it works. Product Owners, Project Managers, Scrum Masters, Designers, Backend Development, and Frontends whatever the position you are doing try to know the limits, the responsibilities of each other.

Being concerned about the value that every part of the team brings to the table, the effort makes you don't undervalue the Job of anybody, help where you can, analyze better some technical details when it includes cross-teams effort.

Understand the business side of the project.

### Beyond code

I am one of those who thinks that not everything that comes to mind needs to be told and it's ok to not have an opinion on everything (unless this is your Job)

There are a lot of no-code-related things we need to work on and learn

**Communication:**

**Processes:**

**Business vs Tech:** At the end of the day we are doing software for people to help them but also to get some revenue in most cases. As software developers, we need to know in what situations

-   Talk to buy time and do a better implementation if is a big important feature for the business
-   The latest thing is not better, the best is what gets the job done
-   When a business expectation is not realistic and needs to be broken.

**Mentorship, talks:** Something I look forward to doing more

### **Have an opinion but be realistic**

At the beginning of my career, I used to dislike **code challenges that weren’t a reflection of the day-to-day Job tasks,** I still kind of dislike them but I am more open and in fact, prefer live coding rather than project assignments (because the latest requires more time and on top of that you have to explain while in the former you can explain and interact with an interviewer right there). I know it is not ideal but is the only tool they have to make sure they are going for the person they will pay.

I still need to do some improvements in the complex code, **FAANG-like coding challenges** as I know I am not in a position of changing a standard you got to play by the rules of the game

### Feet on the ground

-   Underpressure
    
-   100%, not 105%
    
    ```
       Time is an asset that we don't recover. Keep. Rest is important 
    
     - On trust (everything on paper)
    
     - Stability 
    
       The best stability is to be prepared because everything can change.
    
      Opportunities come so try to be prepared when they
    ```
