Hello, this is the second version of the year in review by me, this time I want to set clear goals at the end of this write-up to review at the end of the year.

## Development

- This year was a little bit moved in terms of professional experience as I had my first opportunity to lead a team and we did great things, moved out of my comfort zone and changed jobs for the first time after 4 years of working with my first employer and I learn so much from that experience.


- Started mentoring other devs in Vue, something I wanted to do for a long time.

- Regarding personal projects, I defined the main idea of [Loger](https://github.com/jesusantguerrero/atmosphere) and I plan to release a public demo in the first Q of this 2023, I started a project with a friend that has great potential here in my region let's see how it goes.

## Writing

I kept blogging consistently  inÂ **[dev.to](https://dev.to/jesusantguerrero)**  this year and was almost the same pace as the previous year. I have some unpublished drafts but 7 articles were published:

My favorites were: 

[Best stacks to build vue applications](https://dev.to/jesusantguerrero/best-stacks-to-build-vue-applications-2man)

[Deploying and hosting Full-Stack Laravel apps](https://dev.to/jesusantguerrero/deploying-and-hosting-full-stack-laravel-apps-1673)

[Five years into software development](https://dev.to/jesusantguerrero/five-years-into-software-development-2f9p)

## Reading 

This year I just read one Book but I read a lot of great dev articles.
