In the first edition of my website [jesusantguerrero.github.io](https://jesusantguerrero.github.io) I did a live portfolio showing projects But this time I wanted a way of digital Home where I put my thoughts about the things I like (programming, vue, philosophy, music, writing) as well as a Digital Garden and any thing I have that is worth sharing.

All that with a minimalistic design ond the plan is to always keep this as a work in progress.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
